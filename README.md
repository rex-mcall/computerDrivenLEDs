### Computer Driven LEDs

---

## This code is designed to allow the computer to talk to an Arduino over a USB COM port.

To get this to work properly, you have to change the batch files to work on the correct COM port that your Arduino is connected to. The default for my Arduino/computer setup is COM3, but yours could be different.

You also have to make sure you have the Adafruit NEOPIXEL library installed.
